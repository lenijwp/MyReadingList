## Dying ReLU adnd initializer
### Motivation
1. Dying ReLU is lack of the theoretical analysis.
### Effect
1. Analyzed the Dying ReLU problem theoretically.
2. Proposed RAI initializer which can improved Dying ReLU problem.

### Detail
Their work has been repeatedly tested on simple fitting problems, and it shows that the initializer they proposed is significantly better than he-uniform, which provides a new idea for solving the dyingrelu problem.
