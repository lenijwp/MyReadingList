### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

#### Motivation
Researches have been conducted on the preprocessing of the emotion system, but the model text preprocessing based on word vectors has not. It is necessary to evaluate the effects of the preprocessing links related to three types of tasks: sentiment analysis, sentiment classification, and irony detection.

#### Effect

1. Experiments and comprehensive analysis were performed using preprocessing techniques on 9 data sets and different emotional tasks of different models.
2. Preprocessing was performed in the training phase and/or task phase to compare the accuracy performance of the word vector model.
3. Evaluate the performance of the best preprocessed word vector model based on the best word vector model.


#### Detail
1. Trained each pre-processing and subtracted all the pre-processing results Fscore on nine data sets, and selected the best and performing pre-processing combination. 
2. Comparing training and adding pre-processing on nine data sets  Add preprocessing and Fscore of both for processing and testing
3. Add preprocessing to compare general excellent models
