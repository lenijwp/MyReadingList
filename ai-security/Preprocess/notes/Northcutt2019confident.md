### Cradle

#### Effect

1. This is the first tool 'cleanlab' to analyze the direct estimation of the joint
distribution between noisy and uncorrupted labels

2. A proof is presented giving realistic sufficient conditions
under which CL exactly finds label errors and exactly estimates the joint distribution of
noisy and true labels


#### Detail

1. They propose a method a clean the wrong labels by the extimation of the joint distribution between noisy and uncorrupted labels and provide the proofs.
2. Their method does improve the accuracy in the imagenet when clean some labels. But too many deleted labels will lead to the decrease of the accracy.
