### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

#### Effect

1. Researched the pre-processing techniques and new techniques in the previous research and studied their significance in feature selection 
2. Suggest techniques suitable for Twitter sentiment analysis and techniques to avoid for researchers


#### Detail
1. Use two three-point classification data sets (positive, negative, neutral), four types of algorithms (linear regression, naive Bayes, neural network (CNN), support vector machine), bag-of-words feature evaluation (tf-idf),  Neural network feature learning method: embedding.  The neural network algorithm is calculated based on word2vector pre-training the word vector; others are vectorized with tf-idf, and then uni-gram 
2. The experiment is divided into two modes: use one by one; use one by one to remove together (ablation study).  In addition, they also studied the impact of a certain technology on the accuracy of prediction.
